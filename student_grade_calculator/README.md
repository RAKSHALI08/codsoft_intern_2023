Users input their marks (out of 100) for each subject, and the system calculates the total marks by summing them up. The average percentage is then determined by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects. Based on the average percentage, the system assigns a corresponding grade. Finally, the results, including total marks, average percentage, and the assigned grade, are displayed to provide users with a comprehensive overview of their academic performance.
